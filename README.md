# Data_Cleaning_Using_SQL
In this project I analysed a dataset I got from 'Real World Fake Data' using SQL, and then visualized it using Excel.

The link to the dataset : https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Call+Center.csv

What I did, step by step:

* Download the csv file
* Import the file to MySQL
* Clean it a litle bit as it was pretty clean to begin with
* Perform EDA
* Visualize it using Excel
